<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file lpm_fifo2.vhd </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of scfifo megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design lpm_fifo2.vhd.  The design lpm_fifo2.vhd has a depth of 512 words of 8 bits each. The output of the fifo is unregistered. The fifo is in show-ahead synchronous mode.  The data becomes available before 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read acknowledge. </P>
